### List of Events

This note supplements the proposal of June 15th, 2023. On a call with Stuart Waldron on July 7th, 2023, the agreement was to start with a list of events for the first 6 months of the cooperation.

Here is the list of events to be targeted for the first 6 months:

- API Days London, September 13/14, 2023, https://www.apidays.global/london/
- API Days Melbourne, October 11/12, 2023, https://www.apidays.global/australia/
- All Things Open, October 15-17, 2023, https://2023.allthingsopen.org/
- API Conference Berlin, October 16-18, 2023, https://apiconference.net/berlin/
- API Days Paris, December 6-8, 2023, https://www.apidays.global/paris/

There is probably one more API Days event in early 2024 (API Days Dubai) and I am currently trying to find out whether it will happen and when.
