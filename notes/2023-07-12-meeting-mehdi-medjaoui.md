## Mehdi Medjaoui, 2023-07-12, 3.00pm CET

- Organize OAI tracks at all API days events
- One 2h session for London
- Longer form and possibly a panel in Paris
- Ideally we want to make sure that customers push vendors to implement new features
- Mehdi makes sure API days submission forms ask about the OAI track
- Erik records a video with Mehdi to start advertising the track
