# Proposal for OAI Certification Program

## Erik Wilde, erik.wilde@dret.net, August 21, 2023

OAI has a strong brand but that one is eclipsed be far by the OpenAPI brand. However, even OpenAPI is not as visible as it could be and probably could be, because it often is treated more as a side issue and not so much as one of the central pillars of how API management happens today. This proposal aims and strengthening both brands, with the goal of an overall improved recognition and visibility, which will translate into increased participation, increased interest in membership, and a better way to work on specifications because of more community involvement.


### OAI Certification Program: Introduction

The OAI certification program is a set of certifications. All of them will be managed in the same way, and will be aligned in terms of processes for how to acquire certificates and how they are designed and provided.

Possible providers for this kind of service are Accredible and Credly and similar providers. There are a variety of providers for this kind of service, and at this point the only important aspect is that OAI does not need to run their own infrastructure. However, of course there need to be processes around how these services are being used and how data underlying the certification process is managed.
