# Proposal for OAI Certificates

## Erik Wilde, erik.wilde@dret.net, August 21, 2023

OAI has a strong brand but that one is eclipsed be far by the OpenAPI brand. However, even OpenAPI is not as visible as it could be and probably could be, because it often is treated more as a side issue and not so much as one of the central pillars of how API management happens today. This proposal aims and strengthening both brands, with the goal of an overall improved recognition and visibility, which will translate into increased participation, increased interest in membership, and a better way to work on specifications because of more community involvement.


### OAI Certificates: Introduction

The OAI certification program is a set of certifications. All of them will be managed in the same way, and will be aligned in terms of processes for how to acquire certificates and how they are designed and provided.

Possible providers for this kind of service are Accredible and Credly and similar providers. There are a variety of providers for this kind of service, and at this point the only important aspect is that OAI does not need to run their own infrastructure. However, of course there need to be processes around how these services are being used and how data underlying the certification process is managed.


### OAI Certificates: Certificate Programs and Levels

OAI may decide to extend the certification practice, but even at the start there already are two programs of certificates that can be envisioned. In order for this to be clearly communicated, it would be necessary to make sure that OAI certificates are always presented in a way that present three levels:

- This is a certificate issued by OAI.
- This is a OAI certificate in a certain program.
- Optional: This certificate represents a certain level in an OAI certification program.

As a start, there are two promising candidates for certificate programs:

- One program is for certifying implementations about their OpenAPI compliance. Whether this program may have different levels or not is not yet clear.
- One program is for OpenAPI proficiency for practitioners. More about possible levels further down, but this program likely would have levels such as "foundations", "developer proficiency", or "product manager".

All programs and levels should be clearly described on the OAI Web site. More about how they are defined later on.
