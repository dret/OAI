# Alternative Proposal for OAI Certification

## Erik Wilde, erik.wilde@dret.net, September 16, 2023

i just had one more idea how we could make certification happen. i'd say it's a bit more risky, depends on everybody trusting each other, but also has a lot more flexibility and potential.

- OAI grants the right to issue "OAI certificates" to some company X. that right needs to be defined in some shape, but not necessarily like we're managing the coca cola brand. it would be something like saying that X is allowed to charge reasonable fees, that everything offered to the outside must be done with OAI's approval, and that the right has to be renewed every year.

- X then goes off and start creating certificates and accreditation programs. since this would require some sort of web presence this would probably require hiring an agency part-time for doing design and development work.

 - for example, for "learning OpenAPI" there are three certificates ("OAI OpenAPI foundations" and so on), and there are clear requirements what trainings need to cover and do. trainers then can apply to become accredited (for a reasonable fee, let's say $1000 for a thorough review of the course program that they submit), they can advertise with the certificate, and they can hand out certificates to people completing courses. after each course they hand over completion lists to X, X issues certificates to attendees (for a reasonable fee which is charged to the trainer, let's say $20 per attendee which covers the fee of platforms like credly plus a little extra for admin work), and we have a well-defined ecosystem.

 - another example is certifying tooling. this will be another set of certificates ("OAI OpenAPI 3.1 Compliance" and so on) and may be self-serve (as envisioned by isabelle), at least at the technical level. depending on the effort this would take, these certificates might be quite a bit more expensive but on the other hand would be issued to software providers (we could make exceptions for free software for example or possibly OAI would pay X for those in an effort to balance the needs of free software projects and services provided by X). X would verify compliance, issue the certificate, and maintain a list of issues certificates (ideally published somewhere).

- depending on the success of the program we could extend the program, but everything visible and available to the public would always need to be approved by OAI. as long as interests are aligned it seems that this could be done without making it too complicated. but like everything else involving brands and licensing this of course has the potential to become very complex. it would be on us to not allow for that to happen.

this is just one more way how we could make this work. mostly i am proposing this because i have noticed that there is a huge opportunity and quite a bit of demand and that things with OAI have been moving relatively slow so far. which is ok because everybody has day jobs and other things to do, but it also makes it tricky to develop these ideas into something that's out there and is making an impact.

i think that a model like the above could help to

- leverage the current OAI brand,
- to help the ecosystem to be more easily navigable for OpenAPI users,
- to help service and software providers with credible certification, and
- to increase the visibility and impact of the OAI and OpenAPI brands.

i am more than happy to discuss this (and all my other) ideas. in the end, i simply see the potential and want to make *something* work, so whatever that may look like is ok for me as long as it means that we can start using, strengthening, and expanding OAI's visibility and brand.
